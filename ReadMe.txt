WQFM
----

WQFM_Final.cpp should work fine. 
WQFM_Final_newInitial.cpp is a slightly modified version where Rezwana implemented a different initial partitioning method for the set of taxa. This version is not yet tested extensively.

The perl script "reroot_tree_new.pl" should be saved in the same directory as WQFM_Final. It requires bioPerl-1.5.2
