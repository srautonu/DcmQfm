Dear Sir,

Assalamu Alaikum. Attached are the updated versions of WQFM. WQFM_Final.cpp should work fine. WQFM_Final_newInitial.cpp is a slightly modified version where Rezwana implemented a different initial partitioning method for the set of taxa. This version is not yet tested extensively. So please start with WQFM_Final.cpp. 

The perl script "reroot_tree_new.pl" should be saved in the same directory as WQFM_Final. It requires bioPerl-1.5.2. I can give you this version of bioperl in case this is no longer available online.

Thanks,
Bayzid
